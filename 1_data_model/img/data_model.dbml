    *A standardized framework and data model for EVM address labeling*

    This initiative tackles the issue of isolated and non-standardized datasets of address labels within the blockchain community. It introduces a flexible, open and community owned data framework for anyone to use and contribute to. 

    The OLI repository functions as the community maintainer of the OLI framework. Additionally, it serves as a neutral entity that provides tools for data entry through attestations and automated activity tagging. Find the OLI repo [here](https://github.com/openlabelsinitiative/OLI).

Table Tags {
  tag_id      string  [pk, note: "Unique identifier for the tag."]
  name        string  [note: "Descriptive name of the tag."]
  description string  [note: "Short explanation of what the tag represents."]
  schema      jsonb   [note: "JSON Schema fragment defining the type, format, and constraints for the tag value."]
  creator     string  [note: "Entity responsible for creating the tag."]

  note: "Tags are metadata labels used for sorting, searching, and categorizing blockchain addresses. Each tag includes a schema that defines its structure and validation rules."
}

Table Framework {
  address string [pk, Note: "the hexadecimal public address of a smart contract or externally owned account (EOA)"]
  chain_id string [pk, Note: "unique identifier as defined by EIP-155 or CAIP-2"]
  tag_id string [pk, Note: "Tag IDs that can represent a wide range of concepts. For OLI-compliant tags, please refer to tag_defintions.yml in the OLI github repo"]
  value string [Note: ""]

  Note: "A many-to-many relationship table that maps tags to addresses, allowing an address to have multiple tag_ids and a tag_id to be applied to multiple addresses."
