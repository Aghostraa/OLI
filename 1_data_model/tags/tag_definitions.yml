# The following tags are used to label the address/contract.

- tag_id: contract_name
  name: Contract Name
  description: This tag refers to the fundamental descriptor that provides a clear and immediate understanding of an address's purpose or role. It should offer a straightforward one-word detailed definition into the functionality of the address. For example, the Uniswap router contract would have the contract_name = 'router'.

- tag_id: paymaster_category
  name: Paymaster Category
  description: >
    Specifies the category of the ERC-4337 Paymaster contract. Paymasters are contracts that can sponsor gas fees for UserOperations (UserOps) by depositing ETH in the EntryPoint contract. Different types of Paymasters implement different logic to determine when to pay. 
    - 'verifying': These Paymasters run custom verification logic (e.g., whitelists) before approving payment.
    - 'token': These Paymasters accept ERC-20 tokens from users and convert them into ETH to cover gas fees.
    - 'verifying_and_token': Hybrid Paymasters that combine both verification and token-based fee payment.

    enum: [verifying, token, verifying_and_token]

- tag_id: is_bundler
  name: Is Bundler
  description: Indicates whether the address functions as a Bundler in the ERC-4337 architecture. Bundlers are EOAs that aggregate multiple UserOperations (UserOps) and submit them to the EntryPoint contract via the handleOps function. They can collect UserOps either directly (common today) or from the ERC-4337 mempool (less widely adopted). Their role is essential in batching transactions and enabling efficient execution of account abstraction flows.

- tag_id: is_paymaster
  name: Is Paymaster
  description: Indicates whether the address is an ERC-4337 Paymaster contract. Paymasters deposit ETH into the EntryPoint contract and can be selected by users to sponsor their gas fees. The EntryPoint contract calls the Paymaster to verify whether it is willing to pay for a given UserOperation, based on custom criteria like app whitelisting or token exchange.
