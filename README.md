# Open Labels Initiative
*A standardized framework and data model for EVM address labeling*

Full data model documentation: [dbdocs](https://dbdocs.io/matthias/OpenLabelsInitiative)

## Goal
This initiative aims to tackle the issue of isolated and non-standardized contract and wallet labeling datasets within the blockchain data community. By introducing a standardized data model for smart contract and wallet labels we advocate for the consolidation into a single, universally accessible data structure utilized by various data providers. Additionally, we also aim to function as an aggregator for labeling tools (i.e. automated ERC detection, activity tagging, etc.)

The Ethereum Foundation funded this effort as part of the [Data Collection Grants](https://esp.ethereum.foundation/data-collection-grants). This standardized data structure was part of their [wish list](https://notes.ethereum.org/@drigolvc/DataCollectionWishlist) and other foundations and data teams also expressed interest in the past (as discussed [here](https://twitter.com/tokenterminal/status/1694103939602608540) by TokenTerminal and MSilb7). 

## Categories
A big part of the labeling effort is to introduce a standardized set of well-defined categories. This is especially helpful in the context of analytics. The categorie definitions and mappings can be found [here](https://github.com/openlabelsinitiative/oli/blob/main/category_definitions.json).

## Data model
This is the current suggestion for the data model. The full dbml definition can be found [here](https://github.com/openlabelsinitiative/oli/blob/main/data_model.dbml).

## Tooling
WIP: a repository of references to labeling tools

## Datasets 
OLI wonâ€™t store any datasets. This initiative's goal is to align on a standardized data structure for labels which will make it easier to sync different datasets. It will also align on the definition of categories and naming conventions. Label databases will still be in the hands of independent data teams. growthepie and walletlabels commit to making their data publicly available via API endpoints and hope that other data teams will join this effort for democratized access to labels.
